the official OWASP Top 10:2025 list:
A01:2025 - Broken Access Control: Remains #1, covering unauthorized access to functions/data.
A02:2025 - Security Misconfiguration: Climbs significantly, focusing on default settings, incomplete configurations, etc..
A03:2025 - Software Supply Chain Failures: New & expanded category, covering dependency issues (Log4j, etc.).
A04:2025 - Cryptographic Failures: Focuses on weak encryption, key management.
A05:2025 - Injection: Still critical (SQLi, XSS), focusing on untrusted input.
A06:2025 - Insecure Design: New focus on systemic flaws in design/architecture.
A07:2025 - Authentication Failures: Weaknesses in identity management.
A08:2025 - Software or Data Integrity Failures: Exploiting integrity, e.g., in CI/CD pipelines.
A09:2025 - Security Logging & Alerting Failures: Insufficient monitoring and logging.
A10:2025 - Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions: New category for error handling issues. 
Key Shifts from 2021 to 2025:
Supply Chain Focus: "Vulnerable Components" expanded to "Software Supply Chain Failures".
Systemic Risks: Emphasis on design flaws (A06) and broader supply chain issues.
New Category: "Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions" addresses poor error/exception handling.
SSRF Integration: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is now under Broken Access Control (A01).
Root Cause Focus: Moving beyond symptoms to underlying design and process issues.
